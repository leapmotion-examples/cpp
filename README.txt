Leap Motion Example CPP Repository
================================================================================

The LeapMotion-Examples cpp repository contains example code for the Leap API built on the JUCE cross-platform 
application framework (http://www.juce.com).

The example applications contain source code and project files and are provided to illustrate some of the creative possibilities
of the Leap Motion controller.

* These examples require use of Leap Service/Daemon 2.X and LeapSDK version 2.X *

Folder contents:
    
    Example programs with source code:
        FingerVisualizer

To compile the example programs, the LeapSDK folder must be in the same
directory as the cpp repository folder. The example projects are set up to
look for the header files and libraries in this location. If you move an
example project or the SDK relative to each other, you must update the include
path for the project.
 
Before running an example or demo program, make sure you are running a version
of the Leap service/daemon compatible with this version of the SDK. You can check
the version number via the Leap Control Panel settings dialog on the about tab.
